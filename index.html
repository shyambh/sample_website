    <h1>Learn Enough Story</h1>
    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach       technical sophistication, the seemingly magical ability to take       command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes       everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,       Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.       We believe there are at least a billion people who can benefit from       learning technical sophistication, probably more.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <h2>Founders</h2>
    <p>
     Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee      Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical      sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit      <em><strong>at least a billion people</strong></em>, and probably more.

    <h3>Michael Hartl</h3>

    <p>
        Michael is the creator of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the <a href="http://learnrnough.org/">Learn Enough to be Dangerous</a> introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of <a href="http://kravmaga.com">Krav Maga</a>. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillian are slightly exaggerated.

    <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>

    <p>
      When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

    <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>

    <p>
    You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd     at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
