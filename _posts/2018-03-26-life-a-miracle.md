Life is a miracle if you want it to be  
Or, an endless tunnel, with no light you can see  
But the sun, the moon and the air is the same  
you can live in a moment's blush, or you can die again  

I wish I was a mystic, high up on a hill  
live in a little hut, silent and still  
But would I find peace within, I shall never know  
For I can never tell, which way my heart will go  

Carry my blessings, my love, and carry my sins  
be the sunshine in my eyes, where it all begins  
Fools and Kings have traversed this dusty road forlorn  
pretending to know it all, but the child has never grown  

It has been written in the stars and in every grain of stand  
the will of the universe, only a few can understand  
For life is a miracle, happening every day  
So live it up while you can, you'll die anyway
