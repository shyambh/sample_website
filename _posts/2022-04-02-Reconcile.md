Yesterday was a tumultuous night  
densely dark and a raging surge  
a night like no night before  
I couldn't see myself in the mirror that night  
Not a pretty sight to see a man  
being possessed by what he's not

As the darkest hour had passed  
some momentary sighs in between  
apart from that  
quietness wrapped itself  
around the carnage that had been left behind  
The storm had finally passed away  
...for now
