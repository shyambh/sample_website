<img src="/assets/images/top-of-the-hill.jpg" width="400">

The silence of the hills  
beneath a thin veil of blue  
criss-crossed by the careless streams  
tonight, I dream of you

The long, winding roads  
disappear near the bends  
serpentine the trodden paths  
the journey never ends

Somewhere in the woods  
on top of the hill  
festooned the crystal stars  
over my window sill

Beneath the river gorges  
in a fit of ravenous delight  
for the veins of the forest have swelled  
with the thunders of monsoon inside
