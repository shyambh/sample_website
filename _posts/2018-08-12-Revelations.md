Break the chains  
the very ones that bind you  
the ones that were traded to you  
by the merchants of lust and dreams  

Break the line  
the line that was set  
by the sheep O' so blind  
who thinks you're one of it's kind  

Think of the people  
who live in the shadows  
for the world has decided  
to turn off the lights  
The wretched, the lonely and the lost  
ride the same train  
never knowing  
which station to get off  

Be the seeker  
for you were meant to be one  
unlearn everything that you picked up  
along the forlorn way  
you were ordered to obey  
and you did just that  
Unquestioningly, unhesitatingly  
for you were promised  
a heaven for your blindness  
blissful light for your ignorance  
Holy water and the Ganges  
to baptize you  
and purge you from your sins  
you were traded chains, my friend  
by the merchants of lust and dreams  

So, break the chains  
for freedom is life  
and what is life  
if you cannot ask  
why, what and where  
without fearing a stare  
the answer to your questions  
you'll find it somewhere  
Just close your eyes  
and look inside for a while  
you'll find what you seek  
the quest will end with a smile  

And that would be the day  
when you'd have broken free  
looking at the eyes of the merchant  
only to see  
he looks a bit like you  
and a bit like me
