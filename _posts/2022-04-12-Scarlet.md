Scarlet,  
wear the ivy upon your hair  
too long I have waited  
amongst the debris of despair

These gusts of breeze  
stems out of the brook  
for miles I have walked  
and years, it took

Your streets talk to me  
with the old familiar tongue  
a quick slip into the past  
and a thousand bells have rung

The child has grown to be  
a man of thirty-three  
still longing for your touch  
still a longing to be free
