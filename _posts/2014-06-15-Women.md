I dont know what feminism is  
Or the threads of its belief  
What I believe is that men and women exist  
half of a four clover leaf

But alas, its a world where men often forget  
that they were once a son  
who couldn't take two nimblest of steps  
without holding their mother's thumb

Women can never be brute for strong  
for it was never once in her seven stars that shone  
Fanatics, would you ever stop to fill  
a man in a woman's bone ?

Let her fly, let her think  
let her speak, let her drink  
Let her cook for the man she loves  
let her smile, let her run, let her blink

Men and the fanatics  
Please lets stop pretending to be blind  
and confess to the world that she is a human too  
the most beautiful of its kind
