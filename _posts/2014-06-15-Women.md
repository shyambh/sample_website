I dont know what feminism is, or the threads of its belief

What I believe is that men and women exist, half of a four clovered leaf

But alas, its a world, where men often forget, that they were once a son

Who couldn't take two nimblest of steps without holding their mother's thumb

Women can never be brute for strong, for it was never once in her seven stars that shone

Fanatic feminists, would you ever stop to fill, a man in a woman's bone

Let her fly, let her think, let her speak, let her drink

Let her cook for the man she loves, let her smile, let her run, let her blink

Men and the fanatics, please lets stop pretending to be blind

And confess to the world that she is a human too, the most beautiful of its kind
